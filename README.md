# Facial Emotion Detector

## Overview

The **Facial Emotion Detector** is a deep learning project that utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect and classify human emotions from real-time webcam footage. It recognizes seven basic emotions: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad, and Surprise. The project uses OpenCV for face detection and Keras for emotion recognition.

## Features

- **Real-time emotion detection**: Captures live video from the webcam and predicts emotions for detected faces.
- **Emotion classification**: Classifies emotions into seven categories.
- **Face detection**: Uses OpenCV's Haar Cascade Classifier for face detection.

## Requirements

Before running the code, make sure you have the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install keras
pip install tensorflow
pip install numpy
```

## Project Structure

│
├── facialemotionmodel.h5            # Pre-trained Keras model for emotion detection
├── realtimedetection.py             # Python script for real-time emotion detection
├── README.md                        # Project documentation (this file)
└── dataset/                         # Folder containing training dataset (if available)
```

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Face_Emotion_By_Amanteja.git
   cd Face_Emotion_By_Amanteja
   ```

2. **Load the model**:
   The model `facialemotionmodel.h5` should already be in the repository. If not, make sure to download it or train it (see model training instructions below).

3. **Run the real-time emotion detector**:
   ```bash
   python realtimedetection.py
   ```

   The webcam will open, and the system will begin detecting faces and predicting emotions in real-time. If the program fails to capture the webcam, ensure the correct camera index (`cv2.VideoCapture(0)`) is set.

4. **Stop the program**:
   Press the `Esc` key to exit the webcam window and close the program.

## Model Training (Optional)

If you wish to train the model from scratch, use a dataset of facial images classified by emotion. The model can be trained on the [FER2013 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data), which contains images labeled with emotions. Below is a high-level summary of the training process:

1. **Prepare the dataset**:
   - Resize images to 48x48 pixels.
   - Convert the images to grayscale.

2. **Model architecture**:
   The CNN architecture consists of several convolutional layers followed by pooling, dropout, and dense layers for classification.

3. **Training**:
   Train the model using `categorical_crossentropy` loss and the `Adam` optimizer.

4. **Save the model**:
   After training, save the model as `facialemotionmodel.h5`:
   ```python
   model.save('facialemotionmodel.h5')
   ```

## Troubleshooting

- **UnicodeEncodeError**: If you encounter encoding errors while displaying emotion labels, ensure your environment is set to UTF-8 encoding. You can also update the code to handle any encoding issues in the `cv2.putText()` function.
- **Camera Issues**: Ensure the camera index is set correctly (`cv2.VideoCapture(0)`).
